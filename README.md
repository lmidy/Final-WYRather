Project Rubric [https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1567/view](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1567/view)

Design Artifacts - used to break down components and force me to think about how to identify reusable components (note this is outdated as I ended up breaking the wouldyouratherwidget (what I originally thought could be question) component into smaller sections to allow for questions, results, etc to be displayed [ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BuLZVO-noE84TTWZfFY7wFjmS2ml9Ijn5Uz4N8V3844/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BuLZVO-noE84TTWZfFY7wFjmS2ml9Ijn5Uz4N8V3844/edit?usp=sharing)

### Known Bugs

Minor - Added label in the would you rather widget I am not passing props to populate the date when a question is getting answered and when a user is viewing results. I may end up removing this entirely if this gets rejected for some reason
